> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for Ionic Projects with Gulp

This is a yeoman generator for my [Ionic Gulp Seed](https://github.com/tmaximini/ionic-gulp-seed), to get things set up faster. It sets up everything to get you started with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) in no time.


### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Installation

To install generator-ionic-gulp from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-ionic-gulp
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo ionic-gulp
```

after installation, just run: 
```bash
gulp
```
to start up the build job and file watchers
